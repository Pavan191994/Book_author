used then didn\\\\\\'t have lower case at all.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthis is a retranscription of one of the first project\\\\r\\\\ngutenberg etexts, offically dated november 22, 1973--\\\\r\\\\nand now officially re-released on november 22, 1993--\\\\r\\\\non the 30th anniversary of his assassination.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n***the project gutenberg etext of kennedy\\\\\\'s inaugural address**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\njfk\\\\\\'s inaugural address, january 20, 1961, 12:11 est\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nwe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . .\\\\r\\\\nsymbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal\\\\r\\\\nas well as change for i have sworn before you and almighty god\\\\r\\\\nthe same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century\\\\r\\\\nand three-quarters ago.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nthe world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands\\\\r\\\\nthe power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.\\\\r\\\\nand yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought\\\\r\\\\nare still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man\\\\r\\\\ncome not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god.\\\\r\\\\nwe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nlet the word go forth from this time and place. . .to friend and foe alike. . .\\\\r\\\\nthat the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans. . .\\\\r\\\\nborn in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace,\\\\r\\\\nproud of our ancient heritage. . .and unwilling to witness or permit the slow\\\\r\\\\nundoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed,\\\\r\\\\nand to which we are committed today. . .at home and around the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nlet every nation know. . .whether it wishes us well or ill. . .\\\\r\\\\nthat we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,\\\\r\\\\nsupport any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and\\\\r\\\\nthe success of liberty.  this much we pledge. . .and more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nto those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\\\\r\\\\nwe pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  united. . .there is\\\\r\\\\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\\\\r\\\\ndivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\\\\r\\\\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\\\\r\\\\nto those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\\\\r\\\\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\\\\r\\\\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\\\\r\\\\nwe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\\\\r\\\\nbut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\\\\r\\\\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\\\\r\\\\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\\\\r\\\\nto those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\\\\r\\\\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\\\\r\\\\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\\\\r\\\\nis required. . .not because the communists may be doing it,\\\\r\\\\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\\\\r\\\\nif a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\\\\r\\\\nit cannot save the few who are rich.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nto our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\\\\r\\\\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\\\\r\\\\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\\\\r\\\\npoverty.  but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\\\\r\\\\nhostile powers.  let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\\\\r\\\\nto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas. . .and let\\\\r\\\\nevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\\\\r\\\\nof its own house.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nto that world assembly of sovereign states:  the united nations. . .\\\\r\\\\nour last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\\\\r\\\\nhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\\\\r\\\\nof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\\\\r\\\\ninvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\\\\r\\\\nand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nfinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\\\\r\\\\nwe offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\\\\r\\\\nthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\\\\r\\\\nby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\\\\r\\\\nwe dare not tempt them with weakness.  for only when our arms are sufficient\\\\r\\\\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\\\r\\\\nbut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\\\\r\\\\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\\\\r\\\\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\\\\r\\\\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind\\\\\\'s\\\\r\\\\nfinal war.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nso let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\\\\r\\\\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\\\\r\\\\nlet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\\\r\\\\nlet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\\\\r\\\\nthose problems which divide us.  let both sides, for the first time,\\\\r\\\\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\\\\r\\\\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\\\\r\\\\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\\\\r\\\\nlet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\\\\r\\\\nof its terrors.  together let us explore the stars, conquer the\\\\r\\\\ndeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\\\\r\\\\nthe arts and commerce.  let both sides unite to heed in all corners\\\\r\\\\nof the earth the command of isaiah. . .to \"undo the heavy burdens. . .\\\\r\\\\nlet the oppressed go free.\"\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nand if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\\\\r\\\\nlet both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\\\\r\\\\nbut a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\\\\r\\\\nand the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nall this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\\\\r\\\\nnor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\\\\r\\\\nnor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\\\\r\\\\nin our lifetime on this planet.  but let us begin.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nin your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the\\\\r\\\\nfinal success or failure of our course.  since this country was founded,\\\\r\\\\neach generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony\\\\r\\\\nto its national loyalty.  the graves of young americans who answered\\\\r\\\\nthe call to service surround the globe.  now the trumpet summons us again. . .\\\\r\\\\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\\\\r\\\\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\\\\r\\\\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\\\\r\\\\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\\\\r\\\\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  can we forge against\\\\r\\\\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .north and south. . .\\\\r\\\\neast and west. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\\\\r\\\\nwill you join in that historic effort?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nin the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\\\\r\\\\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; i do not shrink\\\\r\\\\nfrom this responsibility. . .i welcome it.  i do not believe that any of us\\\\r\\\\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\\\\r\\\\nthe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\\\\r\\\\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\\\\r\\\\nthat fire can truly light the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nand so, my fellow americans. . .ask not what your country can\\\\r\\\\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  my fellow\\\\r\\\\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what america will do for you,\\\\r\\\\nbut what together we can do for the freedom of man.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nfinally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world,\\\\r\\\\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\\\\r\\\\nwhich we ask of you.  with a good conscience our only sure reward,\\\\r\\\\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\\\\r\\\\nthe land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that\\\\r\\\\nhere on earth god\\\\\\'s work must truly be our own.\\''"

worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different r nmen often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it r nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do r nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my r nsentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony r nthe question before the house is one of awful moment to this country r nfor my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of r nfreedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject r nought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that r nwe can hope to arrive at truth and fulfill the great responsibility r nwhich we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions r nat such a time through fear of giving offense i should consider myself r nas guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of disloyalty r ntoward the majesty of heaven which i revere above all earthly kings r n r nmr president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope r nwe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the r nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts is this the part r nof wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty r nare we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not r nand having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their r ntemporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost r ni am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it r n r ni have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of r nexperience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past r nand judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct r nof the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with r nwhich gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house r nis it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received r ntrust it not sir it will prove a snare to your feet suffer not yourselves r nto be betrayed with a kiss ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our r npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and r ndarken our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and r nreconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that r nforce must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves r nsir these are the implements of war and subjugation the last arguments to r nwhich kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if r nits purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other r npossible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of r nthe world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies no sir r nshe has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other r nthey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the british r nministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them r nshall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years r nhave we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the r nsubject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain r nshall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication what terms shall we r nfind which have not been already exhausted let us not i beseech you sir r ndeceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert r nthe storm which is now coming on we have petitioned we have remonstrated r nwe have supplicated we have prostrated ourselves before the throne and have r nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and r nparliament our petitions have been slighted our remonstrances have produced r nadditional violence and insult our supplications have been disregarded r nand we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne r nin vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and r nreconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be free r nif we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which r nwe have been so long contending if we mean not basely to abandon the noble r nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged r nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest r nshall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight r nan appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us r n r nthey tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable r nan adversary but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week r nor the next year will it be when we are totally disarmed and when a british r nguard shall be stationed in every house shall we gather strength by r nirresolution and inaction shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance r nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until r nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make r na proper use of those means which the god of nature hath placed in our power r nthe millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a r ncountry as that which we possess are invincible by any force which our enemy r ncan send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone r nthere is a just god who presides over the destinies of nations and who will r nraise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the r nstrong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir r nwe have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late r nto retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery r nour chains are forged their clanking may be heard on the plains of boston r nthe war is inevitable and let it come i repeat it sir let it come r n r nit is in vain sir to extenuate the matter gentlemen may cry peace peace r nbut there is no peace the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps r nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms r nour brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle r nwhat is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear r nor peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery r nforbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take r nbut as for me give me liberty or give me death "
